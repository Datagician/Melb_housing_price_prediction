Melbourne Housing Price Prediction Model
This project aims to predict house prices in Melbourne using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features such as the number of rooms, type of property, location details, and more.

Steps Involved:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features and selecting the most relevant ones to improve model performance.
Model Building: Implementing various machine learning models including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning model parameters to optimize performance using techniques such as Grid Search and Random Search.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R^2) score.
Model Deployment: Finalizing the best-performing model and preparing it for deployment.
Results:
After thorough analysis and fine-tuning, the best model achieved the following results:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 168,013.29
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 78,623,099,553.63
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 280,398.11
R-squared (R^2) Score: 0.8014
This project demonstrates the entire machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment, providing valuable insights into the Melbourne housing market.
